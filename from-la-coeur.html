                    <p>Hey Janny,</p>
                    <p>It took me a while to decide how to wish you on your first birthday since we became good friends. I took notes, paid close attention to details, and eventually settled on a shortlist of three ideas. I thought about singing 🤣 (just kidding—I’d rather walk into parliament wearing only my boxers 😂😂). But in all seriousness, I went with the most dramatic option: a website hosted on GitHub, tailored just for you. It includes three things: this letter, a poem, and a gallery (which I really hope to have enough time to refine properly).</p>
                    <p>This letter has a simple subject: you. We haven’t been friends for long, but my word, you are something else. That first letter on Slowly was all about your name. I had never seen—and I kid you not—a name as beautiful as yours. After you taught me the pronunciation, I’d randomly say it while walking and think, “Damn, what a name.” It was enchanting, almost. And then there was your voice. I was shocked (in the best way). It sounded like pouring the finest bottle of Bordeaux wine into a beautifully ornamental glass—crystal clear. I think my shock was evident when I compared you to a siren 😂.</p>
                    <p>As time goes on, you’ll come to realize that you came into my life at the most perfect time, and boy, am I glad you did. You have this way about you—it’s hard to put into words (which is surprising, given my background in human behavior and whatnot). What I’m really trying to say is: I’m incredibly thankful for who you are and that you’ve become a part of my life. I admire you loads and absolutely adore you. You’re like a hot cup of chocolate on a cold day, or that cozy feeling when it’s raining, and you crawl into bed, pulling the sheets over your whole body.</p>
                    <p>I could go on and on, but for modesty’s sake, I’ll keep it neat and tidy. A new chapter begins in your life—no doubt a rollercoaster (that’s how it feels to go from being a carefree child to a grown-up with responsibilities). There’ll be really lofty highs and some devastating lows (hopefully more of the former than the latter). There’ll be times you might hate your life or even yourself, but there’ll also be plenty of moments when you’ll smile so wide, you’ll outshine the sun.</p>
                    <p>When the lows come, I hope you remember this: you are one in a billion. You’re so damn awesome—except for your dancing atrocities (shudders) and your constant love for the word “Horh” 😂. But hey, nobody’s perfect, right?</p>
                    <p>I’m human, and so is everyone around you (well, most of them—I hear some people identify as cats nowadays 🤣). There’ll be times when people are there for you every second, times when they’ll want to be there but can’t, and times when they won’t be there at all (I’m proudly in the first two categories 😁). But no matter where, what, or when, remember this: you’ve got enough awesome in you to pull through. (You probably don’t need to hear all this, but I can’t help it 🙃.)</p>
                    <p>I’ll stop here before I embarrass myself further. Happy birthday, Janny. I’ll forever be grateful for your Chapter 21 because it brought our paths together, and I’ll be here for as long as you want me to. To your Chapter 22—may it be the dandiest and grandest the world has ever seen. Salut! 🥂</p>
